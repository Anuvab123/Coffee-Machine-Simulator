# Coffee-Machine-Simulator:
This is a console application written in Java that simulates a Coffee Machine. The simulator allows users to manage the coffee machine by buying coffee, filling ingredients, taking money, showing remaining ingredients, displaying analytics, and exiting the simulation.

# Features:
The Coffee Machine Simulator has the following features:

1. Buy Coffee: Users can select from different types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) and buy a cup of their choice. The coffee will be dispensed only if there are sufficient ingredients in the machine; otherwise, an error message will be displayed. The money box will be updated with the price of the coffee, and the remaining ingredients will be adjusted accordingly.

2. Fill Ingredients: Users can add ingredients to the coffee machine. The simulator assumes that the machine can hold an infinite amount of ingredients. Users can 3. specify the amount of water, milk, and coffee beans to be added.

4. Take Money: The maintainer of the coffee machine can take the money stored in the money box. This will empty the money box.

5. Show Ingredients: Users can check the remaining ingredients in the coffee machine, including the amount of water, milk, and coffee beans.

6. Analytics: Users can view analytics that display the count of each type of coffee sold, the total amount earned, and the total ingredients consumed.

7. Exit: Users can choose to exit the simulation, ending the program.
